# 🌊 Plane Wave Propagation – Manim Visualizations

This repository contains a collection of animations built using **Manim** to demonstrate **plane wave propagation** through various types of media in electromagnetic theory (EMT).

---

## 🎯 Objective

To visually explain how electromagnetic plane waves propagate and attenuate in:
- Lossless Medium
- Lossy Medium
- Good Conductors
